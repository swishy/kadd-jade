# iQk! Usage #

iQk! s interface was intentionally kept simple and clean, once iQk! fires up youll be greeted with the game mode screen from here you can select " _Solo_ " or  " _Multi_ " :

**Solo basically takes you straight to the main game view and bypasses the iQk! server select screen**

**Multi takes you to the iQk! server select screen so you can pick another iQk! session to connect to.**

**NOTE!** By selecting " _Solo_ " or " _Multi_ > _Create Server_ " a iQk! server will be created on your phone for others connect to so even in a solo session others can connect to your session once they are able to.

Once you have arrived at the main iQk! screen ( _affectionally known as the iQk! GooView_ ;-) ) you can trigger sounds by touching one of the 12 regions defined on the screen , by tilting the iPhone right or left you will get another 12 sounds loaded up while the iPhone/iPod is tilted.
These sounds will be played on **ALL** iPhones/iPods connected to your session, so even if you are not in the same area as the rest of the people in the session you can hear what everyone else is playing!.

# Preferences #

Keeping with the simple theme there is currently only one option being the nick name, the preferences screen can be accessed by shaking the iPhone/iPod once, from here you can type your preferred  nick name which will be used as the identifier in the server select screen ( _This will show as " <preferred nick> 's iQk! " on other iPhones/iPods_ ).
Once this has been typed in touch outside the text box to dismiss the keyboard and shake to return to the main iQk! screen.
